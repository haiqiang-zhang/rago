# RAGO: Systematic Performance Optimization for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Serving

RAGO is a tool for modeling and evaluating the performance and efficiency of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) serving. This repository is an open-source implementation for the ISCA'25 paper [RAGO: Systematic Performance Optimization for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Serving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14649). 

RAG is a genAI paradigm that combines generative LLMs and retrievals:

RAGO is a system performance optimization framework. It searches for the optimal system configurations (task placement, resource allocation, and batching policy) based on the specific RAG algorithms and underlying hardware:  

![RAGO Overview](figures/paper_workflow.png)

RAGO takes two sets of performance files as inputs: (a) LLM inference performance results and (b) retrieval performance results. Both LLM and retrieval performance can be either (a) profiled on real machines or (b) modeled by simulators such as [Generative LLM Analyzer](https://github.com/abhibambhaniya/GenZ-LLM-Analyzer). It then evaluates the end-to-end performance Pareto frontier (e.g., time-to-first-token latency, throughput, etc.) by assembling inference and retrieval. 

## Getting Started

### Install

```
conda create --name rago python=3.11
conda activate rago

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Example RAG performance analysis 

We provided some example RAG pipelines. The description of these RAG workloads can be found in [examples/README.md](examples/README.md).

To run some examples of RAG pipelines:

```
cd examples
python example_case1.py
```

The output performance figures can be found in [examples/img](examples/img).

### Inference Performance

Here we use [GenZ](https://github.com/abhibambhaniya/GenZ-LLM-Analyzer) as an example simulator to produce some performance results based on different hardware and models. You can find a more detailed description in [llm_sim/README.md](llm_sim/README.md).

To use them: 

```
# Initialization
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd llm_sim/genz
git checkout cb2448332a1a83eec52cd6e3b7919d56eaff380c
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the analysis
cd ../genz_scripts
python llm_perf.py
```

The results can be found in [llm_sim/genz_scripts/perf_results](llm_sim/genz_scripts/perf_results).

Any other simulators or real profiles can be looped in, as long as they produce the same performance csv format. 

### Concrete device mappings

In the RAG-Stack integration, RAGO owns physical candidate materialization.
`enumerate_concrete_device_mappings` expands a chip-count placement into the
topology-distinct ordered device layouts that can change model cost (for
example same-pair versus cross-pair placement on a 4-GPU, two-pair fabric).
Each returned `PhysicalMapping` carries `available_devices`,
`resource_group_devices`, `stage_devices`, and a stable `device_layout_id`.

Within one collocation group, smaller co-resident engines follow a canonical
balanced policy: in stage order they rotate round-robin over the group's
ordered ranks; full-width engines occupy all ranks. Consequently alternate
rider stacking is not a separate search dimension. This is the same policy the
measured RAG-Stack layout resolver uses, so replay and candidate search retain
the same stage-to-device occupancy.

### Retrieval Performance

The retrieval performance model and its usage is decribed in [retrieval_sim/README.md](retrieval_sim/README.md). The performance model is based on the [ScaNN](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann) vector search library.

```
cd retrieval_sim
python retrieval_perf.py 
```
